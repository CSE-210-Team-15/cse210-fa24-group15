# Fork from existing repo https://github.com/refinedguides/kanban-board as starting point

## Context and Problem Statement

Which existing repository should we build our solution off of?

## Considered Options

- [Todo list 1](https://github.com/Kritika30032002/To-Do-List-Application/blob/main/index.js)
- [Todo list 2](https://github.com/Lordwill1/todo-list/blob/master/JS/main.js)
- [Kanban board 1](https://github.com/refinedguides/kanban-board)
- [Kanban board 2](https://github.com/gateremark/droppi-kanban-board)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Kanban board 1". Fits our prototyping and vision the most.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Todo list 1

- Good, because tooling is simple
- Good, because it is written in vanilla JS, HTML and CSS
- Good, because tasks have a priority field built in, which matches our design
- Bad, because to do lists don't match our initial exploratory designs
- Bad, because the interface has little room to build on

### Todo list 2

- Good, because tooling is simple
- Good, because it is written in vanilla JS, HTML and CSS
- Good, because it has a clock built in, which we can repurpose for the timer aspect of our design
- Bad, because to do lists don't match our initial exploratory designs

### Kanban board 1

- Good, because tooling is simple
- Good, because it is written in vanilla JS, HTML and CSS
- Good, because our initial ideas are more similar to a kanban board
- Good, because it is minimalist in design so it is easy for us to build on

### Kanban board 2

- Good, because tooling is simple
- Good, because it is written in vanilla JS, HTML and CSS
- Good, because our initial ideas are more similar to a kanban board
- Bad, because dragging and editing use the same clickbox, which is a bit clunky
