# Decision Record: Using JSDoc for Documentation

## Context and Problem Statement

**What methods can be used to efficiently generate documentation for code?**  
As our project grows, we need a solution to create and maintain consistent, clear documentation efficiently. The chosen method should minimize manual effort, integrate well with the codebase, and support scalability.

---

## Considered Options

### 1. **Manual Documentation**

Writing documentation manually using external tools like Word, Notion, or Google Docs, which are separate from the codebase.

### 2. **Using JSDoc**

Embedding structured comments directly in the code and leveraging JSDoc to automatically generate documentation.

### 3. **Integrating Full-Fledged Documentation Tools (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI)**

Employing API-focused tools that require maintaining separate definition files for documenting APIs.

---

## Decision Outcome

We decided to use **JSDoc** for our project.  
JSDoc is a lightweight tool that integrates seamlessly into the codebase. It simplifies documentation generation and aligns with our projectâ€™s requirements.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### 1. **Manual Documentation**

- **Pros:** Flexible, no changes to code required.
- **Cons:** Prone to becoming outdated, labor-intensive, and lacks standardization.

### 2. **Using JSDoc**

- **Pros:** Integrates with the code, automates documentation updates, and improves code clarity.
- **Cons:** Requires adherence to JSDoc syntax and some initial learning for team members.

### 3. **Integrating Full-Fledged Documentation Tools**

- **Pros:** Advanced features for APIs.
- **Cons:** Overkill for non-API-focused projects, adds complexity.
