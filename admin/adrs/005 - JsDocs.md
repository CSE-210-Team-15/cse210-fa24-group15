## Context and Problem Statement

What methods can be used to efficiently generate documentation for code?

## Considered Options

- **Manual Documentation**

Writing documentation manually using external tools such as Word, Notion, or Google Docs, separated from the code.

- **Using JSDoc**

Adding structured comments directly in the code and using JSDoc to automatically generate documentation.

- **Integrating Full-Fledged Documentation Tools (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI)**

Employing tools designed for API documentation, which typically require separate definition files for APIs.

## Decision Outcome

We decided to use **JSDoc** for our project.
JSDoc is a lightweight tool that integrates seamlessly into the codebase, meeting our needs.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

1. **Manual Documentation**
**Pros:** Flexible, no changes to code required.
**Cons:** Prone to becoming outdated, labor-intensive, and lacks standardization.
2. **Using JSDoc**
**Pros:** Integrates with the code, automates documentation updates, and improves code clarity.
**Cons:** Requires adherence to JSDoc syntax and some initial learning for team members.
3. **Integrating Full-Fledged Tools**
**Pros:** Advanced features for APIs.
**Cons:** Overkill for non-API-focused projects, adds complexity.
