# Choosing ESLint and Prettier for Linting and Formatting

## Context and Problem Statement

For our project, we need to ensure that the codebase maintains a consistent style and is free of common issues that could affect code quality. To achieve this, we need a set of tools that will help with:

1. **Linting**: Identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript code that may lead to bugs or undesirable practices.
2. **Formatting**: Ensuring consistent code formatting across the entire project.
3. **Automation**: Ensuring that linting and formatting happen automatically before committing code.

The goal is to choose tools that are widely used, easily integrated into our workflow, and provide flexibility and customization for our project. 

So which tools to choose? 

## Decision
We have chosen **ESLint** for linting and **Prettier** for code formatting, which will be run automatically using **Husky** before each commit.

### ESLint (for Linting)
ESLint is a widely used tool that helps identify potential issues in JavaScript code and enforces coding conventions. It has extensive support for configuration and rules, making it a popular choice for JavaScript projects.

#### Pros:
- **Highly Configurable**: ESLint allows you to define custom rules for your project or use widely accepted style guides (like Airbnb, Standard, or Google).
- **Wide Adoption**: ESLint is the most popular linting tool in the JavaScript ecosystem and is supported by many other tools and plugins.
- **Extensive Ecosystem**: There are many plugins available for integrating with other tools (e.g., React, Vue, TypeScript, etc.).
- **Supports TypeScript**: ESLint can be extended to support TypeScript through plugins, making it a great choice for both JavaScript and TypeScript projects.
- **IDE Integration**: Most IDEs and text editors (VS Code, Atom, Sublime, etc.) support ESLint, providing real-time linting feedback.

#### Cons:
- **Configuration Complexity**: ESLint can be complex to set up, especially if you want to use custom rules or integrate with other tools. However, popular configurations (like Airbnb) can reduce this complexity.
- **Performance**: ESLint can be slow with large projects or complex configurations, though performance is generally acceptable for most use cases.

### Prettier (for Formatting)
Prettier is a tool that automatically formats code according to a consistent set of rules, ensuring that all code looks the same, regardless of who writes it.

#### Pros:
- **Zero Configuration**: Prettier enforces a single, consistent code style without requiring much configuration. This makes it easy to adopt and reduces decision fatigue.
- **Automatic Formatting**: Prettier automatically formats code as you write it, either in the editor or through pre-commit hooks, ensuring that code is consistently formatted.
- **Works Well with ESLint**: Prettier and ESLint are often used together to handle separate concerns—Prettier takes care of formatting, while ESLint deals with linting. Prettier can even be integrated with ESLint to avoid conflicts.
- **Supports Multiple Languages**: Prettier supports a variety of languages (JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, JSON, etc.), so it’s useful for full-stack projects.

#### Cons:
- **Limited Customization**: Prettier has fewer configuration options compared to ESLint, and the rules are stricter. Some developers may prefer more control over formatting, but Prettier aims for simplicity and consistency.
- **Possible Conflicts with ESLint**: If not configured properly, Prettier and ESLint may enforce overlapping rules (e.g., formatting), leading to conflicts. This can be resolved by using the `eslint-plugin-prettier` plugin.

### Husky (for Automating Linting and Formatting)
Husky is used to automate the linting and formatting steps by running them before each commit via Git hooks.

#### Pros:
- **Prevents Bad Code from Being Committed**: By running linting and formatting checks as part of the Git commit process, Husky ensures that code adheres to quality standards before it enters the codebase.
- **Easy Integration**: Husky integrates easily with both ESLint and Prettier and can run them as part of a `pre-commit` hook.
- **Supports Other Hooks**: Husky can be extended to support other hooks, like `pre-push` or `pre-merge`, to run additional checks as needed.

#### Cons:
- **Performance Overhead**: Running linting and formatting checks before each commit can add some overhead to the commit process. However, the benefits of having clean, consistent code outweigh this trade-off.
- **Requires Setup**: Husky needs to be set up initially and configured with the necessary hooks. This setup complexity is minimal but still needs attention.

## Alternatives Considered

### TSLint (for Linting)
Before the widespread adoption of ESLint, **TSLint** was the default linter for TypeScript projects. However, TSLint is now deprecated in favor of ESLint, which provides better integration with TypeScript and more flexibility.

#### Pros:
- Tailored for TypeScript.
- Was widely used before being deprecated.

#### Cons:
- Deprecated and no longer maintained.
- ESLint is now the recommended tool for both JavaScript and TypeScript.

### StandardJS (for Linting)
**StandardJS** is a JavaScript style guide, linter, and formatter. It enforces a strict set of formatting rules with zero configuration.

#### Pros:
- No configuration required.
- Enforces a strict, consistent code style.

#### Cons:
- Very opinionated and rigid, which may not fit all projects.
- Less flexibility in choosing custom rules compared to ESLint.

### ESLint + Stylelint (for CSS Linting)
While **Stylelint** is a great tool for linting CSS, we chose to focus on JavaScript linting with ESLint and use Prettier for formatting. For projects with significant CSS code, **Stylelint** would be a useful addition.

#### Pros:
- Great for CSS linting.
- Highly configurable.

#### Cons:
- Requires additional configuration for integration with ESLint and Prettier.
- Not necessary for this project, which focuses primarily on JavaScript.

## Conclusion
After evaluating various linting and formatting tools, we decided to use **ESLint** and **Prettier** for the following reasons:
- ESLint provides robust linting with excellent support for customization and plugins, making it ideal for maintaining code quality.
- Prettier offers automatic, consistent formatting with minimal configuration, saving time and ensuring a uniform code style.
- Both tools are widely adopted in the JavaScript ecosystem, ensuring strong community support and resources.

We believe that combining ESLint and Prettier with Husky for automation will provide a reliable, streamlined workflow for maintaining high code quality in our project.
