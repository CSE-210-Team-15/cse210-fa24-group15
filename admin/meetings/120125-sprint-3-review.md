## Accomplishments

### Overview

The team has made significant progress across key areas of the project. Code quality was enhanced through restructuring, resolving Codacy issues, and adding input validation for unique task names and valid estimated times. Game logic saw major advancements, including implementing pet behavior and shop functionality, such as deducting coins when a pet is purchased. User experience was enhanced with updates to the Shop-UI, seamlessly integrating it with game logic. We enhanced the time-boxing aspect of the kanban board by enabling auto-start for tasks moved to "In-Progress,". Overall, the group demonstrated strong collaboration and steady progress toward project goals.

### Individual Notes

- Soumya: Worked on code restructuring, unit testing and game logic
- Joey: Enabled auto-start for the tasks when dragged to "In-Progress"
- Yuan: Worked on testing of the game logic
- Steve: Implemented the game logic (reducing coins when a pet is purchased) for the Shop-UI
- Gavin: Worked on pet and game logic 
- Sakshi: Worked on unit testing
- Kuber: Resolved Codacy issues in the code, worked on input validation (unique task names and valid time estimated)
- Li: Worked on JSDoc Documentation 

## Spillover

We are still having codacy quality issues, which we plan to address in the following sprint. Testing is also facing issues with import and required statements. We also want to increase the test coverage overall.
