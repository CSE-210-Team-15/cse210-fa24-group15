## Sprint 2 Retrospective:

### Liked

- Daily standup thread is helpful for knowing what people are up to
- Work volume is adequate (we 'finished' most of what we planned for)
- GitHub project tracking is good (backlog is useful for separating out
priority tasks and more 'optional' ones)
- Pair (or more) programming is quite helpful when we did it

### Lacked

- Tasks could've been distributed more evenly (some tasks were underassigned
and could've used more hands)
- Need to do more end to end testing earlier on
- Need to pay more attention to our code quality (project structure especially)
- Can be more clear about requirements (what constitutes as a 'finished' task)
- Communication between groups working on things dependent on other groups

### Learned

- Try to do more pair programming
- Online meetings aren't great for us, try to shift more to in person
- We will try to follow a standard/convention with regards to commit messages

### Conclusion:

We noticed that communication between team members working on different tasks is
an issue for us, and that will be more important as more tasks become dependent
on each other. We will continue encouraging participation on the daily standup
thread and pushing for more frequent in-person meetings.
