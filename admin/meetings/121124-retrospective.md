## Sprint 4 Retrospective

### Liked

- Communication has improved compared to the last sprints.
- Everyone was responsive when required.
- Everyone showed up to the meetings, despite the finals weeks.
- Work delegation is done appropriately, keeping in mind the different finals week schedule for everyone.
- Testing is taken seriously.
- Work was done efficiently.
- In-person meets helped with efficiency and the overall development process.

### Lacked

- Should not have prolonged pushing to the main for too long, especially since it affects the testing and dependencies.
- Researching testing before implementing it.
- Testing should have been done as we code and written by everyone.

### Learned

- Clear communication when there are dependecies involved
- Researching and importance of ADRs before finalizing any big design change.

### Conclusion

We enjoyed working on this project. The team has always been enthusiastic about the app that we decided to build, right from ideation to the hype video. We finished everything that we set out to build in these 4 weeks. We do think that testing is something that we could have started a little earlier, and worked on it more. While the brownfield code was meant to help us focus on the game part and not the kanban, the code written wasn't written in the best way possible, which required us to change it quite a bit. It would have been much cleaner and better testable had we written it from scratch. Overall, we learned a lot in this process and enjoyed building the product.
