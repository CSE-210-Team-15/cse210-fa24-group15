## Sprint 3 Retrospective:

### Liked

- The team and the project progress was going as expected.
- Work allocated was fun.
- Manageable expectations were set.
- Everyone had a clear understanding of who worked on what aspect of the projet.

### Lacked

- Since we were in teams, while the teams knew what was beinng done by others, tracking exact progress of the other team was tricky.
- Communication was tricky as most members were not available given thanksgiving break/ travel.

### Learned

- Testing along side coding is helping the overall development process and guides on what needs to be tackled in the next sprint.

### Conclusion:

The team is comfortable with the tasks allocated. There was a little struggle in communication in the later half of the sprint. We plan to have more meetings in a week virtually to checkin on progress to improve any communication gaps.
