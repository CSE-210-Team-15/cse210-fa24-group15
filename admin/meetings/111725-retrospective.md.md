## Sprint 1 Retrospective:

### Liked
- Delegated tasks equally
- Everyone had something to do
- The team knew the general direction and goals of the sprint
- Work allocated was adequate and manageable
- Our task manager (Github Project) is simple and easy to use

### Lacked
- Did alot of things last minute (right before the sprint review),
leading to lost time to things like merge conflicts
- Mid-sprint communication and knowing the status of each task
during the sprint
- Some better planning, especially end-to-end
- Alot of individual efforts, but lack of cohesion

### Learned
- We will add a 'backlog' and 'in-review' columns to Github Projects,
to help us better track the status of tasks
- We will create a new Mattermost channel called 'stand-up', where 
before each midday, every team member will write one message
on what they plan to work on (or not work at all) for that day

### Conclusion:

The sprint laid a solid foundation for both CICD processes and application functionality. Moving forward, we plan to expand test coverage with more edge cases, implement comprehensive testing.
